# NewsSense
 NewsSense is an AI-powered system designed to analyze mutual fund and ETF performance by connecting it with real-world events and news. The project leverages natural language processing (NLP) techniques, including entity extraction, sentiment analysis, and summarization, to provide insights on why a fund's performance is up or down, based on the latest news and market events.
